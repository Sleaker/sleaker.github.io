      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm a tinkerer at heart and love learning new languages and technologies. I have a passon for finding ways to improve tooling, and software automation. Recently I've dabbled with lxc, node.js, ruby, javascript, css, sdl and c. I've been involved with various open-source projects, such as <a href="https://www.github.com/Milkbowl">Milkbowl</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/SpoutDev">Spout</a>, and <a href="https://www.github.com/SpongePowered/">Sponge</a>. I also help give advice related to voxel game development and moderate the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/voxelgamedev">/r/voxelgamedev</a> sub-reddit.  I'm an avid fan of <a href="http://www.usaultimate.org">Ultimate Frisbee</a>, Video Games, and a Certified Judge for Magic: The Gathering</p>
