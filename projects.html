      <h3> <a href="https://www.github.com/Milkbowl/Vault">Vault</a></h3>
      <p>I helped build and improve Vault because I needed a universal API to access multiple economy, permission and data plugins from within my own Bukkit projects.  This is what lead to the creation of Vault as a standalone project.  It is now used on around <a href="http://mcstats.org/plugin/Vault">50,000 servers</a> worldwide daily.
