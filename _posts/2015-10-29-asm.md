###A Bit of Assembly
I'm throwing in the towel for [week 4] of the [Nand to Tetris] project. I was able to verify my solutions work properly for both the multiplication problem and the screen fill problem, but for some reason the automated checker has additional conditions beyond the stated requirements in the project goal so it's failing 'on line 3 of the comparison,'  but there's no way for me to verify what it's actually comparing against.  

I've verified that my fill application fills the virtual screen white and black depending on key press per the spec, but it still failed.  I even switched it so it would push the entire screen black or white on a single press/release rather than needing to hold the key down.  The multiplier program was trivial to make, as you only really need to accumulate and then sign check the arguments.  Either way, I can say I really don't like the hack assembly language, and hopefully I wont need to deal with it for very much longer.  I was also really looking forward to learning some assembly when I looked at the course overview, but the specific language we implemened here doesn't look anything like x86 assembly I've seen floating around the web.

Next week's course has me dealing with assembling all of the components into a runnable PC, which after this weeks course seems like it will be much more fun.
