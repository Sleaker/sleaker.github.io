###Where to Begin
A couple days ago I thought I should look into doing a blog site.  I've been thinking it would be a great way to show off the things that I've been working on, and give me a concrete place to write about the things I'm learning.  The first thing that I looked for was a CMS of some sort that was 'git-backed' but this didn't really turn up anything useful. There are a few frameworks out there to accomplish this, but I realized I just needed a simple way to statically host a blog.  I found [Jekyll] which ended up being able to fulfill exactly the niche that I am looking for.

###Jekyll
So Jekyll was a bit confusing at first, I'm accustomed to server software that hosts specific websites that you've built.  Instead jekyll builds out the website from templates and then dumps the content into a servable directory.  After getting jekyll installed and playing around with a few of the configuration variables I want on the search for some alternative pre-built templates. [autm-rb] is what I found, and I ended up customizing it for myself.  So that's where we are at now. A nice little blog where I can post.

###Open Source Society
As it turns out, the same day I decided to get a blog going, I saw a link come through on stack overflow to [Open Source Society].  OSS is a course collection designed to teach someone the equivalent of a bachelor's in Computer Science.  Although I'm employed as a Software Developer, I haven't received a bachelors degree and sometimes I feel as if there are holes in my knowledge or times that I really don't know where to go to expand my scope into lower level ideas.  I've tried doing some MOOCs but the quality can be lacking, or there is a lack of community interaction with them.  These are things the OSS is attempting to help solve, by providing a community and a clear curriculum.  I decided to sign up for it, it's all self-driven, but hopefully with a growing community around it, it will stay engaging.
