###[Cubed]

Cubed is a small tech-demo for Voxel-based rendering utilizing the [jMonkeyEngine] platform.  I built it to learn the differences between greedy and naive meshing, and how to handle face-merging techniques with textures.  Cubed utilizes my Java port of [libnoise] to show off basic pseudo-random terrain generation.
