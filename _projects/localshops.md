### [LocalShops]

[LocalShops] is a bukkit plugin which allows Players and Server Admins to setup localized shops to their Minecraft server interactible through chat commands.  Some of the features I worked on were AABB collision detection, internationalization support for commands, configurable shop access lists, server-wide and world-wide shops, item-type detection, and the ability to buy or sell items by clicking on signs within the shops.
