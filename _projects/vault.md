### [Vault] & [VaultAPI]

I helped build and improve Vault because I needed a universal API to access multiple economy, permission and data plugins from within my own Bukkit projects.  This is what led to the creation of Vault as a standalone project.  The project includes live [statistics] provided by bstats.org.
